SMALL TASKS

New features:
* Implement text alignment in canvas_draw_text: left, center, right
* Make status boxes have centered text
* Draw direction arrows
* Draw updating status texts
* Draw code text
* Draw an editor cursor (when editing)
* Draw the currently instruction line with white background (when running)

Cleaning up:
* Let canvas decide the display write order - because it needs it to be Y major
  - possibly by adding a display_set_write_order function and calling it in canvas_init
* Tidy up src/avr/panic.c to use pin abstraction (maybe?)

Nice to have:
* Also compile most apps/*.c files for PC.
  (Possibly by adding a apps/avr/ directory for the AVR-only apps.)
* Implement uart.h for PC.
* Connect some push buttons for easier debugging and testing



MEDIUM TASKS

* Calculate status values from CPU state
* Run emulated CPU on an AVR
* Implement display.h for PC using (for example) SDL



LARGE TASKS

* Implement a program parser
* Design and implement a communication protocol
* Run two emulated CPUS on separate AVRs
